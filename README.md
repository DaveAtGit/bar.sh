`bar.sh`
========

> i3 status_command script

This script provides a (theoratically shell agnostic) way
to retrieve system information and provide them for i3wm's
status bar.

This script is by no means correct nor the most efficient
one. It also is kinda hacked for my device(s) to work and
thus you might have to change a lot to get it to work for
you.

Just put `status_command sh path/to/bar.sh` into your i3
`bar` configuration block.

Do whatever you want, but please remember to mention me as
the original author.
